# Find pi using Numerical Integration
## Overview
Write a multi-threads code accelerating the process of computing pi.
## Algorithmic Strategy
Compute π by finding the area of a unit circle, i.e., a circle with radius `r=1`. The formula for the unit circle is `x2 + y2 = 1`. Solving for y, we get the formula:
```
y=1−√1−𝑥2
```
Since the entire circle’s area is π, by adding up the areas of rectangles that approximately cover the area, we will find π.
